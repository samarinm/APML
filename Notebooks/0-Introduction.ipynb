    "and **knowledge discovery** as well as some of the most relevant Python libraries for Machine Learning. Of course, we\n",
    "won't be able to provide an exhaustive presentation of all topics and their mathematical depth. The goal of this \n",
    "course is to give you a practical introduction with some real-world examples. There might be some additional topics, \n",
