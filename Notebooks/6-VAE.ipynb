    "## Latent Variable Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent variable models (LVMs) are statistical models which consider random variables.\n",
    "Suppose that our observations $X$ and $Y$ are random variables following a probability \n",
    "distribution $p(X,Y)$. LVMs assume that there are **latent, i.e. unobserved or hidden, variables** $Z$\n",
    "which have a relationship to our observed data $X$ and $Y$. A typical assumption, for instance is,\n",
    "that our predictors $X$ are generated by **lower-dimensional latent variables** $Z$, e.g. $p(X \\mid Z)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have seen models such as these already. For example, in a **Gaussian Mixture Model** datapoints $X_i$ belonging to cluster $i$ with mean $\\mu_i$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma_i$ are generated by sampling from\n",
    "$\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_i, \\Sigma_i)$. In other words, the low-dimensional latent variables are $Z=(\\mu, \\Sigma)$. **PCA** is another example where few principal components can allow describing the majority of variation in a dataset. However, these **linear LVMs** assume linear relationships between latent variable $Z$ and the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the highly non-linear nature of neural networks, we can use neural networks to extend models such as PCA to\n",
    "**non-linear LVMs**. Here, we pick up the previously encountered idea of compression:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><center><img src=\"images/Compression.png\" alt=\"Image compression with Fast Fourier Transform\" width=\"600\"/></center></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is an unsupervised neural network approach which attempts to identify a\n",
    "meaningful **latent representation** $Z$ capable of reconstructing the original input as perfectly as possible. \n",
    "The VAE can be viewed as probabilistic non-linear PCA, with the general idea being illustrated in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/VAE_idea.png\" alt=\"Variational Autoencoder Illustration\" width=\"400\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The VAE has three important components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enocoder**: The encoder neural network attempts to compress the relevant information about $X$ in latent representation $Z$ with dimensions $d_X > d_Z$. The goal of the encoder is to parameterise a distribution $q_\\phi (Z \\mid X)$ which provides us a (variational) approximation for the distribution of the (compressed) latent variables $Z$ given an input $X$. Here, $\\phi$ denotes the weights of the encoder network. We typically assume that this approximation is given by a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N} (\\mu_Z,\\Sigma_Z)$ where $\\mu_Z=(\\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_{d_Z})$ and $\\Sigma_Z=(\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_{d_Z})$ containing only the diagonal entries of covariance matrix $\\Sigma_Z$ (all other entries are 0). For technical reasons (details omitted), we require the **reparameterisation trick** to sample latent variables $Z$: $$z_n( \\varepsilon ) = \\mu_{Z}(x_n) + \\Sigma^2_{Z}(x_n)  \\varepsilon$$ with $\\varepsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Latent representation / space** $Z$: Datapoints from the input space are mapped into the lower-dimensional latent space $Z$. To start with, we typically assume that the latent variables $Z$ are normally distributed, i.e. a prior distribution $p(Z) = \\mathcal{N} (0,\\mathbb{1}_{d_Z})$ with $d_Z$ being the number of latent dimensions. We train the encoder such that the (posterior) distribution $q_\\phi (Z \\mid X)$ matches the prior $p(Z)$ as much as possible. The deviations from the prior distribution will capture important features of our dataset. We measure the difference in these distributions with the (non-negative) [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) $$D_\\text{KL} \\big(q_{\\phi}(Z \\mid X) \\Vert p(Z) \\big) = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d_Z} (1 + \\log \\sigma_i^2 - \\mu_i^2 - \\sigma_i^2),$$ where the last expression follows from the Gaussian distrubtion assumptions outlined before.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decoder**: The decoder neural network attempts so reconstruct the original input $X$ from the compressed representation $Z$. The goal of the decoder is to parameterise the likelihood $p_\\theta (X \\mid Z)$ with decoder network weights $\\theta$. The **reconstruction error** is measured by the log-likelihood $\\log (p_\\theta (X \\mid Z))$ which in the case of regression tasks is typically given by the mean-squared error loss and in classification tasks by the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these ingredients, we obtain the VAE loss function which is usually referred to as negative **evidence lower bound (ELBO)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "   \\text{Loss} (\\phi, \\theta)= \\frac{1}{s} \\sum_{i=1}^{s} \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{q_{\\phi} (z \\vert x_i)} \\big(- \\log (p_{\\theta}(x_i \\vert z)) \\big)}_\\text{reconstruction loss} + \\underbrace{D_\\text{KL} \\big( q_{\\phi}(z \\vert x_i) \\Vert p(z) \\big)}_\\text{latent loss}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ is the batch size (denoting that we sum the results for different batches). Note that the VAE objective has two parts which we try to balance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **reconstruction loss** measures how well we can reconstruct the input $X$ from the compression $Z$. In other words, this term is an incentive to provide as much information of $X$ in $Z$ as possible, i.e. less compression.\n",
    "2. The **latent loss** measures how well the posterior $q_{\\phi}(Z \\mid X)$ agrees with the prior $p(Z)$. This term favours stronger compressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this probabilistic framework, we can now explore the latent space $Z$ and, in particular, pick\n",
    "latent points in $Z$ to generate novel artifical objects by decoding the picked latent point!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement and apply a VAE on MNIST! For this, we first define \n",
    "a class for the model which provides the individual parts as outlined above."
